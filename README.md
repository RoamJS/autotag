Automatically tag pages that exist in your graph!

When turned on, on block exit

 1. Links any exact match page references (full word, no partial matches)
 2. Aliases any case insensitive matches
 3. Creates links for natural language dates `friday` => `[[July 15th, 2022]]`

`Alt + i` to turn on, or click the eye icon in the topbar.

**Exclusions:** Create an [[autotag-exclude]] page. Add pages you want to exclude (i.e., not be autotagged), in a comma-spaced list without [[ ]], as the first block on that page.
